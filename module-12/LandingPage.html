                        After I finished the 7th grade at middle school, I volunteered at the Millard Branch Library before going into the 8th grade, and I would mainly help out with organizing books in alphabetical order on carts or stock them on the shelves.

                        I started volunteering at the Millard Branch Library again around early March of 2013, and in that time is where I helped out with other activities such as teen gaming, or helping out with organizing different events
